# The Odin Project
Learning to code on your own sucks. It's time consuming, difficult to stay motivated, and lonely. To top it all off, you usually don't even know if you're learning the right stuff, whether the goal is to build the website you want, start a startup, or get a job as a web developer.

The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.

Because it's hard! It takes about 1,000 hours of work to go from zero to employable as a web developer. The project aims to solve the biggest issues of that journey -- knowing what to learn and build and finding other students to learn with along the way.
